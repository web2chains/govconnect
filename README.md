## Overview

GovConnect is a blockchain-powered digital voting platform developed to address the core challenges of Indonesia‚Äôs electoral process. Traditional elections in the country suffer from inefficiencies, high logistical costs, lack of transparency, and limited accessibility in remote areas. Moreover, only 58% of citizens fully trust election results (Kompas R&D, 2024), indicating a critical need for modernization.
GovConnect offers a secure, transparent, cost-efficient, and scalable solution. By leveraging smart contracts, decentralized infrastructure, and biometric authentication, it enables a voting system that is real-time, verifiable, and accessible to citizens across all regions, including those overseas or in underdeveloped areas.


### Key Features
- Digital E-KTP: A blockchain-based voter ID system accessible only to the verified owner.
- Real-Time Voting Analytics: Live visualizations of vote counts, percentages, and regional distributions to ensure transparent and informed monitoring of the election process.
- Smart Contract-Based Voting: Every vote is executed transparently and automatically on-chain.
- Multi-Layer Authentication: Combines biometric and email-based verification to prevent identity fraud and double voting.
- Immutable Vote Ledger: Votes are permanently recorded on the blockchain, enabling public auditability.

### Problem Statement

Indonesia‚Äôs electoral system faces multiple structural and operational issues, including:

- Vote manipulation through technical or political tampering
- Opaque vote-counting processes that limit public verification
- High operational costs due to physical polling logistics
- Limited voter access in remote or infrastructure-deficient regions
- Declining public trust in electoral institutions and outcomes

These challenges present an urgent need for a trustworthy digital transformation.


### Proposed Solution

GovConnect is designed to overcome the issues above by delivering:

- Fully on-chain vote recording using Internet Computer smart contracts (Motoko canisters)
- Real-time, transparent vote counting and live regional breakdowns
- Up to 83% cost reduction through elimination of physical logistics
- Wider reach via web-based access from any device, anywhere
- Stronger voter trust through biometric identity checks and open-source verifiability

  
### System Architecture

GovConnect is developed using modular, decentralized technologies native to the Internet Computer ecosystem:

- Frontend: React.js with @dfinity/agent for secure canister communication
- Smart Contracts (Logic Layer): Motoko-based canister handling elections, votes, identity, and more
- Backend & Storage: No Node.js or centralized backend; all state is maintained on-chain in stable memory
- Security: Built-in TLS, Principal-based access control, and Internet Identity authentication
- Voter Verification: NIK & identity form matching, plus optional biometrics confirmation

## üì¶ Development Setup
- Frontend :
  - NodeJS : [Install Here](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs)
  - npm : [Install Here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm#checking-your-version-of-npm-and-nodejs)
- Canister (Backend) :
  - dfx (For Motoko) : [Install Here](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/getting-started/install/)

- Visual Studio Code : [Install Here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- Git : [Install Here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Github : [Create Account Here](https://github.com/)

## üìù Guide to Run GovConnect
1. Open your Visual Studio Code
   
2. Run on terminal this script
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/web2chains/govconnect.git
   ```
3. Go to this directory on your terminal
   ```
   cd govconnect
   ```
4. Run on terminal this script for installing all dependencies
   ```
   npm install
   ```

5. Go to /src/votingapp_frontend directory, and run this command for installing all depedencies :
  ```
   npm install
   ```

6. Start the Internet Computer Local Replica
   ```
   dfx start --background
   ```

7. Deploy the Motoko Canister
   ```
   dfx deploy
   ```
This will:

Compile the Motoko code in src/votingapp_backend

Deploy it to the local replica

Generate a frontend connection script with the backend canister ID

‚úÖ After deployment, take note of the canister ID, especially for votingapp_backend


8. Run the Validation Server (NIK/Identity Validator)
   
Navigate to the lib directory inside the frontend and start the validation server:
   ```
   cd src/votingapp_frontend/src/lib
   node validateServer.js
   ```

This starts a local validation server to simulate SIDALIH/NIK checks. It typically runs on http://localhost:3001

9. Run the Frontend Locally
   ```
   cd src/votingapp_frontend
   npm run start
   ```

10. Access the App
